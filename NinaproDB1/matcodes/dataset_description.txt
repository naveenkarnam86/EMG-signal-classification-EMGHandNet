Brief description of ninapro dataset:- The data set consists of 52 class hand movements obtained from 27 subjects. The data set is subdivided into three exercise categories as given in table 1

Table 1:- Table providing no of classes in each exercise
Exercise No of classes  Label               Gesture
                        0                     Rest
E1          12          1-12            Individual finger extension or flexion
E2          17          13-20,20-29,  Isometric and isotonic configurations, Wrist movements
E3          23          30-52           Grasps and functional movements


The ninapro folder contains 27 sub folders with naming S1,S2,...S27. Each folder consists of 3 mat files S1_A1_E1.mat, S2_A1_E2.mat and S3_A1_E3.mat.

Each exercise.mat file is a structure consisting  of  the following fields namely emg and stimulus, repetition and exercise number

The emg structure consists of 10 channel semg data obtained from ottobock sEMG sensors 

The stimulus consists of the class label (1-12 for E1, 1-17 for E2 and 1-23 for E3)  corresponding to each class of data

The repetition field consists of the number of trails (10) each activity is performed 

Each activity is performed for a duration of 5s, and sampling frequency is 100Hz. Hence the trail length is considered as 513 samples
 
The total number of samples are 14,040 (27*52*10)
